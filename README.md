Determine what parts are real and what needs to be simulated? 

Depending on the specific component that is being tested or the type of test scenario. 

1. **Component Test: Control Unit**

**Real Parts**: Control Unit (physically present in the data center).

**Simulated Parts:** Machine behavior is simulated using a software or hardware simulator that can emulate responses the control unit would receive from a real machine.

**Use Case**: We can simulate various states of the machine (e.g., active, inactive, error states) and verify that the control unit sends appropriate commands and reacts correctly to simulated machine responses.

1.  **Component Test: Machine**

**Real Parts**:

The physical machine or its control system, equipped with sensors and a modem for network communication.

**Simulated Parts**: Control unit behavior is simulated using software that sends predefined commands to the machine.

**Use Case**: We can verify how the machine reacts to various control commands, such as changing directions or responding to emergency stop commands.

Sensors: Device monitoring tools - activity, location, error state, velocity (etc.)  

1.  **End-to-End (E2E) Test: Control Unit and Machine Integration**

**Real Parts**:

- Control Unit in the data center.
- Machine in the field with its sensors and modem.

**Simulated Parts**:

Some network conditions (like extreme latency) might still be simulated if they are not naturally present during testing.

**Use Case**: This setup allows for a complete validation of the protocol in a real-world scenario. It checks if the control unit and machine communicate correctly under standard conditions and respond well to unexpected conditions like network interruptions.

Additionally non-functional requirements can be checked on this stage, such as: 

- Encryption: Ensure that all data exchanged between the control unit and the machine is encrypted and cannot be intercepted or altered by unauthorized parties.
- Authorization: Ensure that only authorized control units can communicate with the machine, and that both the control unit and the machine properly validate each other's identities.
- Performance: Ensure that the system can maintain proper communication even with high latency or low bandwidth.
- Network  and Power Failures: Check how the system can handle network disruptions and behaves when either the control unit or the machine is restarted or loses power unexpectedly.

### Summary of Different Setups

| **Test Type** | **Real Parts** | **Simulated Parts** | **Focus** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Component Test: Control Unit** | Control Unit, network hardware | Machine behavior, network conditions | Verifying control unit's command handling |
| **Component Test: Machine** | Machine, sensors, modem | Control unit behavior, network conditions | Testing machine’s response to commands |
| **E2E Test** | Control Unit, Machine, network | Some network conditions (if required) | Verifying interactions between components, checking non-functional requirements  |

Have you planned different zones (places, locations) in your test setup?

### Summary of Zones

| **Zone** | **Location** | **Purpose** | **Key Components** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Center Zone** | Secure, indoor environment | Manage control unit operations and monitor network traffic | Control Unit, network hardware, servers |
| **Field Zone** | Real-world operational area | Validate machine's response to commands in real conditions | Machine, sensors, modem |
| **Network Zone** | Between Data Center and Field | Simulate network conditions affecting communication | Modem, routers, network simulation tools |
| **Testing Lab Zone** | Controlled testing environment | Develop and run tests in a controlled setup | Simulation software, automated testing tools |

Testing tools: 

### 1. **Network Analysis Tools**

 To capture and analyze network traffic between the control unit and the machine:

- Netcat, Wireshark

### 2. **Simulation Tools**

- Mocks - to simulate requests and responses between the control unit and the machine.
  For example: 
    
    https://github.com/mattrobenolt/node-mock-udp
    
- Performance and load testing tool - Apache JMeter, iPerf, …

### 3. Automated Testing Frameworks

- **For Protocol Specificity**: Python + socket, Java + JUnit for the functionality
- **For  Integration**: Python Robot Framework for high-level scenarios.
